# CaloriesX (Calories Burnt Predictor)

This model uses XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to predict the number of calories burned based on various input features. XGBoost is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosted decision trees, which is well-suited for regression tasks like predicting calorie burn.

🌟 Input features: Likely include factors such as duration of exercise, type of activity, heart rate, age, gender, weight, and height.

📊 Output: Predicted number of calories burned.

🔗 Linear regressor: While XGBoost is typically used for non-linear relationships, it can be configured to act as a linear regressor by setting certain parameters.

🚀 Advantages: XGBoost is known for its performance and speed, handling of missing data, and built-in regularization to prevent overfitting.

📚 Training: The model would be trained on a dataset of labeled examples, where the actual calories burned are known.

🎯 Hyperparameter tuning: To optimize performance, parameters like learning rate, tree depth, and number of estimators would be tuned.

📏 Evaluation: Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) would likely be used to assess the model's accurac
